Overview:
This project involves natural language processing (NLP) using Keras and TensorFlow. It focuses on text preprocessing, tokenization, and implementing a deep learning model with layers such as RNN, Embedding, and Dense. The notebook includes various steps to process text data and train a model.

Requirements:
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas keras tensorflow

Features:
Text tokenization and preprocessing using keras.preprocessing.text
Embedding layers for word representation
Implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Model training and evaluation

Files:
Untitled0.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for text processing and model implementation.

Usage:
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Untitled0.ipynb
Run the cells sequentially to process text data and train the model.
Modify the dataset or model parameters as needed.
